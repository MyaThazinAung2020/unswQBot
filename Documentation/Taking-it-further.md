# Taking it further
If you need assistance with your deployment of QBot, you can get in touch with [Antares Solutions](https://antares.solutions). 

## QBot Personal Chat
QBot doesn't reply with answers in a private chat. It will be possible to implement this behaviour, however group collaboration and tagging won't be possible if QBot can't find the answer. Alternately. QBot can respond to course administration-related questions in the personal chat for eg: When's my next quiz? This will require you to creatively derive the course context from the user as one user can be part of multiple courses

## Improve answer selection experience
1. Allow selected answer to be updated when a better answer comes in
2. Allow a conversation reply to be directly marked as the answer using [Message Actions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/messaging-extensions/how-to/action-commands/define-action-command#choose-action-command-invoke-locations)
3. Implement select answer experience as a [task module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/task-modules-and-cards/what-are-task-modules)

## Media attachment support
A possibly useful extension to the way you manage your courses might be to detect media attachments (such as photos, video and attachments) in messages

## Analytics and reporting
QBot captures data about who is asking questions, what are they asking and who is answering. Surfacing the analytics via reporting can help course administrators determine how to improve the learning experience.
